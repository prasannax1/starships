Star Trek type starships

## Exodus Class

![Mother Ship](mothership.png)

Exodus Class Super Heavy Cruiser/Carrier

 * Length: 1500m
 * Width: 800m
 * Height: 220m
 * Decks: 30
   * Saucer Section: 8 decks (+ 60m tall hangar)
   * Sphere Section: 30 decks
   * Engine Section: 22 decks
 * Auxillary Craft:
   * 8 *Pioneer Class* Light Explorer/Scout vessels
   * 24 *Vulture Class* Light Escort vessels
   * 1 *Spock Class* Diplomatic Yacht

At almost a kilometer and a half long, the *Exodus Class* is an incredible 
behemoth. Equipped with transwarp engines, The *Exodus* is meant to 
transport daughter ships to another quadrant - or even beyong the Galaxy
and act as a starship, starbase and fleet HQ all in one.

The 800m wide saucer section is bigger than the biggest ships so far by
itself, and is split into 16 sectors, each sector containing a massive
hangar in the lower section and livable area in the upper section. All in 
all it's big enough to be a city by itself.

The *Exodus Class* cruises at a sedate warp 6, and can move at warp 7 
when the engine is at maximum warp; which it never will be since the 
primary mode of propulsion for this juggernaut is transwarp.

The *Exodus Class* is built to work without access to a starbase for up to 
twenty years - in fact, with industrial replicators on board this ship 
serves as starbase to itself and the ships contained in it.

The *Exodus Class* isn't going to win any beauty contest - nor for that
matter any races at warp - but it does a job no other ship can do.

## Pioneer Class

Pioneer Class Light Eplorer/Scout

 * Length: 195m
 * Width: 66m
 * Height: 31m
 * Decks: 7
   * Saucer Section: 3 decks
   * Engine Section: 4 decks
 * Auxillary Craft:
   * 2 Small Shuttles
   * 1 Work Bee

The *Pioneer Class* is the workhorse of the *Exodus* mini-fleet. Fast, agile
and reasonable powerful, this ship is supposed to do the bulk of the exploring
on any mission.

The *Poineer Class* is built for speed and it shows in the smooth ergonimic
design of the starships. It cruises comfortably at warp 9, and can do 9.99 
when you put your foot down.

The *Poineer Class* has comfortable labs and bridge, but no holodecks and
everyone has to double up for the bunk beds - even the captain. The shuttle
bay on this ship is one of the smallest on any starship but it can hold two
small shuttles, and a workbee for any external repair work.

The *Pioneer Class* typically rendezvous with the *Exodus* mothership after 
every mission or so, but it follows the *Voyager Protocol* and can work without
access to a starbase for up to three years.

The *Pioneer Class* is designed to be everything you would expect in a starship
and to also fit in the hangar of an *Exodus Class*.

## Vulture Class

 * Width: 26m
