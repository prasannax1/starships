 - Decks: 67[^decks] 
 - Crew Capacity: 5000
   - Maximum evacuation limit: 100000
 - Warp Speed
   - Cruising: Warp 6
   - Peak: Warp 9.5
   - Transwarp: TW10

[^decks]: Or 95, depending on if decks of the G class are counted.

### Description

The Atlas class is a massive ship almost 2KM long. 

It is mainly used as a mobile starbase and colony transporter. A typical mission of
the Atlas class is to transwarp to unexplored space with entire colonies settled in its
massive living areas, and allow the bulk of the exploration to be done by smaller ships.
Once the exploration is done colonies are settled down and the ship returns back to 
federation territory.

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-standard.png)

The Atlas is intended to be on 20 year deep space missions between refits. Having industrial
replicators on board, the Atlas doesn't even have to be physically present at a starbase for
refits - it can download the specs and do a refit wherever it is.

### History

The Atlas program was started right as the Galaxy Class was being constructed as a future
replacement for the Galaxy Class. In it's original form the Atlas was a single ship with
massive hangars combined with the main saucer that would hold *Nova* sized vessels for 
mission specific exploration.

But after the Dominion war the whole program was put on hold as Starfleet was not in favor
of sending civilians in a starship, not to mention presenting such a large target. It was 
noted that an *Atlas* (in its original design) could carry up to 8 *Defiant* class ships,
but it was much cheaper and easier to just send 8 *Defiants* to any situation than to send
an *Atlas* and deploy them.[^defiants]

[^defiants]: Of course as Starfleet had neither a working Atlas class, nor for that matter 8 *Defiant*s, 
    the whole discussion was deemed moot.

At the same time Starfleet was exploring the Multi-Vector Assualt paradigm, the *Atlas* team
decided to incorporate some of the principles from that approach and sell the *Atlas* as what
eventually turned out to be 7 separate ship types that join up as one or can operate independently.[^multivector]

[^multivector]: It should 
    be noted that though the *Atlas* borrows heavily from Mutli-Vector Assault Vehicles, it is not 
    intended to be used as a Multi-Vector Assault vehicle. While the ship can undock its components faster than 
    a *Galaxy* class saucer separation, the ship does not have the centralized control grid that make a multi-vector 
    ship; once it splits, it becomes separate ships.


This approach was much more successful as individually, most of the components of the *Atlas* 
found enough of a niche to justify the entire ship.

### Structure

The Atlas is a fairly conventional looking starship, looking deceptively delicate due
to the scale of the ship.

The Atlas is an amalgamation of 8 ships, each of which can operate independently in
a specialized or generic role.

#### Atlas-A Class

![Command Ship](images/mother/command.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/command.stl)

Atlas-A Class Exploratory Cruiser and Command Vessel

##### Stats

  - Length: 388m
  - Width: 180m
  - Height: 57m
  - Decks: 12
  - Crew Capacity: 350
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 7
    - Peak: Warp 9.8

##### Description

The Atlas-A class acts as the command module and bridge of the Atlas in regular operation
but also doubles up cruiser capable of versatile roles.

The Atlas-A class midway in size between a Constitution class and an Excelsior and is generally used in most of
the same capacities - as the flagship of the Atlas mini-fleet and as a space control vessel.

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-command.png)

##### Structure

The Atlas-A follows a fairly conventional primary hull, secondary hull and warp nacelles 
structure. The saucer is roughly split into these sections:

 - The 32m structure at the top is the main bridge and command module
 - The 120m wide 2 deck high structure next contains the officers quarters, sickbay and
main messhall
 - The next 180m wide 3 deck high part comntains the rest of the crew quarters, science
labs, auxillary sickbay and main computer core.
 - The 32m wide structure at the bottom of the saucer section contains the aeroshuttle 
lauch mechanism. The aeroshuttle extends to the upper deck as well.

##### Auxillary vessels

 - Type 20 small shuttles
 - Type 23 medium shuttles
 - Type 3 large shuttles
 - Pirahna Class fighters

#### Atlas-B Class

![Transwarp Ship](images/mother/transwarp.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/transwarp.stl)

Atlas-B Class Multimission Explorer and Science and Research vessel

##### Stats

  - Length: 1012m
  - Width: 250
  - Height: 110m
  - Decks: 7
  - Crew Capacity: 1200
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 7
    - Peak: Warp 9.95

##### Description

At a kilometer long the B class is a pure research vessel dedicated to scientific research and
experimental propulsion. It rivals several ground based research establishments in the number and
variety of research and experimental space offered.

##### Structure

Due to its nature as a sub-component of a larger ship, the B class has an unusual structure - just a 
slab like structure 9 decks tall

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-transwarp.png)

The primary hull is split into two sections, the main saucer in the rear which contains the main 
command sections and living quarters and common areas, while the ring like area in the fore contains
all the science laboratories.

They are connected by a section which contains 12 intermediate hangars (20m height x 40m width x 100m length)
for intermediate science vessels.

The secondary hull is non-existent, instead the stardrive section is integrated into the aft part of the primary
hull with only the warp engines jutting out.

##### Auxillary vessels

  - Orca-A class heavy tactical runabouts
  - Orbit class Yachts
  - Type 20 small shuttles
  - Type 23 medium shuttles
  - Type 3 large shuttles
  - Amazon Class runabouts
  - Mako class tactical runabouts
  - Ganges class heavy runabouts

#### Atlas-C Class

![Saucer Ship](images/mother/saucer.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/saucer.stl)

Atlas-C Class Multimission Explorer and Super Colony Transport

##### Stats

  - Length: 1062
  - Width: 750m
  - Height: 135m
  - Decks: 27
  - Crew Capacity: 3000
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 6
    - Peak: Warp 8.5

##### Description

The C Class is closest to the original pre-dominion design of the Atlas. The changes would have been
the main saucer would have been 50m taller to hold a hangar for small ship, and the secondary hull would 
have been slightly larger to accomodate a transwarp core.

As it is, the C Class is built like a super Galaxy-class, with an extremely large saucer (bigger than a whole 
Galaxy class ship) which more or less contains a small city inside it.

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-saucer.png)

This city contains long term residence for colony members intended to extreme long term transport, as well as 
accomodation for crew of all components of the Atlas class.

##### Structure

On top of the saucer is the main command area, which is a 32m bridge section followed by a 
120m wide, two deck area just like in the A-Class.

The next section is the main saucer itself, which is 750m wide and 50m tall. This is in effect
a whole city with living areas, schools, colleges, hospitals, parks, etc.[^city]

[^city]: It's common for crew of all Atlas classes to have residence allocated in the C-class and 
    "commute" to their workstation, whereas the living areas on other classes are mainly used as emergency dormitories.

The secondary hull is affixed to the bottom of the main saucer. The first 3 decks of the secondary hull comprise the main
shuttlebay. Connected to the main shuttlebay are 8 independent hangars, which also open up to the outside to the sides.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Type 3 large shuttles
- Amazon Class runabouts
- Mako class tactical runabouts
- Ganges class heavy runabouts
- Orca-A class heavy tactical runabouts

#### Atlas-D Class

![Scout Ship](images/mother/scout.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/scout.stl)

Atlas-D Class Light Cruiser and Explorer

##### Stats

  - Length: 230m
  - Width: 100m
  - Height: 44m
  - Decks: 10
  - Crew Capacity: 100
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 4
    - Peak: Warp 9.1

##### Description

The D-Class was also concieved at the beginning of the Atlas design process, as the Atlas collection needs a
diplomatic cruiser for the following two reasons:

1. Taking the whole ship to a potentially hostile situation will be risky for the civilian passengers
2. Overwhelming a first contact situation with a kilometer long ship might be overkill and potentially send the wrong message

The D-Class is a light cruiser about the size of a constitution class, but with the smaller saucers has an occupancy 
roughly equal to a Nova class. It can be used as a stand-alone multimission explorer, but with
the Atlas collection is typically used as a first-contact mission diplomatic ship.

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-scout.png)

##### Structure

Despite having to be attached to another ship, the D-Class is built conventionally - quite possibly the most conventional looking
ship in the entire Atlas collection. This is a deliberate decision as the D-class is meant for first contact missions and so is
designed to look very representive of Starfleet and Federation.

The saucer section has a 32m wide integrated bridge and command section. This is followed by the main saucer which is 120m wide and 
two decks tall. The lower section of the saucer has a 32m wide sensor array which also houses the main phasers.

The secondary hull is fairly minimal and fucntional; the engineering section followed by a small shuttlebay.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Bumblebee class Shuttlepods
- Type 20 small shuttles

#### Atlas-E Class

![Carrier Ship](images/mother/carrier.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/carrier.stl)

Atlas-E Class Super carrier and dreadnought

##### Stats

  - Length: 665m
  - Width: 532m
  - Height: 265m
  - Decks: 54
  - Crew Capacity: 250
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 5
    - Peak: Warp 9

##### Description

The E-class came about when the original Atlas had its hangars removed from the saucer section to form the Atlas-C class.

The hangars were incorporated into it's own ship and converted into a super carrier class.

The hangar is big enough to hold full sized starships upto and including *Excelsior* class ships. 

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-carrier.png)


In practice it can hold multiple *Mako* class tactical runabouts for a deadly
strike force.

The ship contains its owm industrial replicator and is used as the main ship factory of the *Atlas* group.


##### Structure

The ship structure resembles the structure of the Oberth Class if the bars connecting the primary hull to the secondary
hulls were converted to entire walls to form the main hangar.

The main saucer is integrated with the engineering section, followed by the hollow section of the main hangar, and at the
bottom is the man cargo bay and antimatter storage.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Full size vehicles
  - Intrepid class cruiser
  - Constitution class cruiser
  - Excelsior class cruiser
  - Saladin/Hermes class
  - Nova class cruiser
  - Defiant class escort
  - Steamrunner class escort
  - Norway class
  - Saber class

- Intermediate ships
  - Orca class light corvettes
  - Raven class science vessels

#### Atlas-F Class

![Escort Ship](images/mother/escort.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/escort.stl)

Atlas-F Class Escort Carrier

##### Stats

  - Length: 220m
  - Width: 164m
  - Height: 30m
  - Decks: 9
  - Crew Capacity: 50
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 7
    - Peak: Warp 9.9

##### Description

The F class is a dedicated escort vessel for the Atlas group.

It is comparable to a *Saber* in size and function and is built with two aims in mind:
1. Fit in the space below the main hangar of the E-class
2. Not win any beauty contests

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-escort.png)

##### Structure

The F-class is built tight, with the warp core integrated into the primary saucer. 

The shuttlebay is longer than you would expect in this class of vehicles and can hold multiple
wings of *Pirahna* class fighters to serve as a light carrier vehicle.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Pirahna class fighters
- Type 20 small shuttles

#### Atlas-G class

![Warp Ship](images/mother/warp.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/mother/warp.stl)

Atlas-G Class Super-heavy warp and transwarp tug

##### Stats

  - Length: 1126m
  - Width: 100m
  - Height: 94m
  - Decks: 28
  - Crew Capacity: 100
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 9
    - Peak: Warp 9.99
	- Transwarp: TW10

##### Description

Unlike the other ships in the Atlas assembly, the G class is not a multi-role ship. It has only one role - 
to use its extremely powerful warp and transwarp engines to pull a super-heavy class object into its warp
bubble and move it elsewhere.

![Ship scale](images/scale/scale-warp.png)

The G class can combine with up to 20 other G classes to create a warp bubble big enough to encase a full starbase
or a small to medium asteroid.

##### Structure

Despite looking like a single unconnected warp engine, the G class is a proper starship. The primary hull is merged into
the body of the secondary hull, as are the warp nacelles which line the entire ventral side of the ship. The dorsal side is
a hangar cum cargo storage bay which opens at both ends and can hold anything from shuttles and runabouts to minor starships.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Intermediate ships
  - Orca class light corvettes
  - Raven class science vessels
  - Orbit class Yachts

- Shuttles
  - Mako class tactical runabouts
  - Pirahna class fighters

### Intermediate auxillary vehicles

These are vehicles that are too big to be  a shuttle or a runabout, but smaller than even the small ships.

These are ships which lie in the 50m to 100m range.

#### Raven class

![Science Ship](images/small/science.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/small/aux/science.stl)

Raven class science ship.

##### Stats

  - Length: 93m
  - Width: 40m
  - Height: 18m
  - Decks: 5
  - Crew Capacity: 25
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 6
    - Peak: Warp 8.8

##### Description

The *Raven* class is effectively an *Oberth* class updated to 25th century technology.

For its size the *Raven* is chock full of labs. It's also built to limp back from damage that can destroy bigger 
ships, since the typical usage for this ship is to go where a full sized starship is too large to go.

##### Structure

As the *Raven* is in between a runabout and a full size starship in functionality so it is in structure - and you
can see elements of both from the shape.

The topmost deck contains a hybrid bridge cum cockpit. The subsequent decks in the 'saucer' section have the labs,
living quarters, messhall, sickbay, etc. The saucer section is followed by the engineering section which continues
into what is quite a large shuttlebay for this size of ship.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Type 20 small shuttles
- Bumblebee Shuttlepods

#### Orca class

![Attack Ship](images/small/attack.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/small/aux/attack.stl)

Orca class light corvette

##### Stats

  - Length: 125m
  - Width: 40m
  - Height: 18m
  - Decks: 5
  - Crew Capacity: 25
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 8
    - Peak: Warp 9.9

##### Description

After the Dominion war Starfleet felt the need for ships that are substantially larger than the *Peregrine* class
fighters, but still smaller than full size starships. The *Defiant* was famously effective but even that was too
big to effectively engage the Jem'Hadar attack fighters.

The Orca was conceived as an intermediate spacecraft that ewould be cheap to build and deploy in numbers, but still 
durable and deadly enough to make an impact. The design team also decided to use the Orca as a proof of concept that
the Multi-Vector paradigm scales down to smaller ships.

Another concept implemented in the Orca class was mutliple warp cores.

This makes the Orca a small and deadly ship that can occasionally be two small and deadly ships.

##### Structure

The Orca is structured like a conventional attack ship, with a primary hull inline with the secondary hull and engine
nacelles trailing behind and below.

As mentioned before, the Orca also splits up into two ships, each of which are worth exploring on their own.[^multivector2]

[^multivector2]: Unlike the Atlas class, the *Orca* is a true multi-vector assault vehicle.

##### Orca-A class / Manta Ray Class

![Attack Ship](images/small/attack-primary.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/small/attack-primary.stl)

Orca-A / Manta Ray class heavy tactical runabout[^orca]

[^orca]: The Orca-A class was initially conceived as a stand-alone ship, named the *Manta Ray*. It was augmented with the Orca-B class, 
    and renamed to the Orca-A.

  - Length: 65m
  - Width: 40m
  - Height: 8m
  - Decks: 2
  - Crew Capacity: 15
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 8.5
    - Peak: Warp 9.5

The Orca-A class pioneered an experimental dual-warp system, where both warp nacelles are powered
by independent warp cores, but with an interconnet to transfer power between the cores as needed.

This achieves several things:
 - faster responsiveness since the warp core is right next to the warp nacelle without a large plasma transfer lag
 - redundancy; in case of emergency both nacelles can be powered by a singe core, albeit with an inefficient power transfer

The dual single-warp-engine arrangement causes the warp field to be unstable at higher warp speeds. The Orca-A class
uses this instability to deliberately generate a warp field for upto a few seconds to as less as a few microseconds, with
alternate nacelles regenerating a warp field just at the moment of collapse. This makes the Orca-A class unusually maneuverable
at warp speeds, able to achieve seemingly impossible tasks as being able to warp through an asteroid field.[^asteroid]

[^asteroid]: Given sufficient advance telemetry, of course. 

The Orca-A class contains powerful mega-phasers powered directly by the warp cores. The redundancy arrangement of the cores
ensures that there is not even a flicker as phaser fire completely drains the power of a warp core. This gives the Orca-A
class the ability to punch beyond its weight class with just phaser fire.

##### Orca-B class

![Attack Ship](images/small/attack-secondary.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/small/attack-secondary.stl)

Orca-B class torpedo boat

  - Length: 96m
  - Width: 40m
  - Height: 18m
  - Decks: 5
  - Crew Capacity: 10
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 6.2
    - Peak: Warp 9.9

The Orca-B class is technically stand-alone but practically much less so than the A-class. The Orca-B class was
conceived as a way of extending the range of the Orca-A class to that of a full size starship.

The main body of the Orca-B is a massive hangar running through the length of the ship split across two levels. 
The fore entrance to the hangar aligns with the aft hangar of the Orca-A class. The aft hangar entrance of the Orca-B
is actually a deck lower than the fore entrance.

The Orca-B also contains the dual-core arrangement similar to the Orca-A, with both cores residing in the respective nacelles,
but it sacrifices maneuverablity for speed and stability. The Orca-B's phasers are less powerful compared to the Orca-A, but
the Orca-B has forward and backward torpedo launchers in the nacelle structure which make up for the loss.

##### Auxillary vehicles

The Orca-A class contains a single *Bumblebee* class shuttlepod.

The Orca-B class can contain upto 3 pirahna fighters, or 5 conventional small shuttles.

#### Orbit class

![Diplomatic Ship](images/small/diplomat.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/small/diplomat.stl)

Orbit class yacht

##### Stats

  - Length: 78m
  - Width: 36m
  - Height: 13.5m
  - Decks: 4
  - Crew Capacity: 30
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 5
    - Peak: Warp 8.2

##### Descriptions

The Orbit class was designed when it was noticed that on most ships the Captain's yacht was seldom
used for the diplomatic functions it was intended for. The ship design team went about designing 
what a yacht would require for diplomatic missions.

##### Structure

The yacht looks like a full size shape at first glance. This is a deliberate choice, and for similar
reasons as the Atlas-D class itself - it  was deciced that a starfleet first contact vessel should
look like a starfleet vessel.

The interiors of the vessel are fairly conventional except that instead of science labs the saucer 
section has large luxury accomodations. In effect this is a glorified taxi ship although it does
not lack sensors or scientific capabilities.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Bumblebee Class shuttlepod


#### Iceland class

![Yacht](images/small/yacht.png)

  - Height: 14m
  - Decks: 4
  - Crew Capacity: 30
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: Warp 4
    - Peak: Warp 8

##### Descriptions

The Iceland class is a general purpose yacht which is bigger than a regular runabout, but smaller than a heavy
runabout, although it has a higher capacity due to its 4 decks.[^iceland]

[^iceland]: Frequently the Iceland class is used as a MEDEVAC vehicle due to its higher number of decks in such a
    small ship.
    
##### Structure

The two deck primary hull sits on top of the secondary hull with the warp nacelles extending downwards. At the aft
part is a small hangar able to contain workbees or a small shuttelpod.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Bumblebee Class shuttlepod

### Conventional auxillary vehicles

These are regular sized shuttles and and runabouts.

#### Bumblebee class

![shuttle Pod](images/small/shuttlepod.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/small/shuttlepod.stl)

Bumblebee Class Shuttlepod

##### Stats

  - Length: 3m
  - Width: 2.5m
  - Height: 1.8m
  - Crew Capacity: 2
  - Warp Speed: no

##### Description

The Bumblebee is a minimal shuttlepod that is built to safely take two people from orbit
to a planet's surface, and then safely back.

The Bumblebee has another property that it is extremely small. Hence it is used as auxillary
ship in intermediate and small starships.

#### Type 20 class

##### Description

The type 20 is the standard workhorse shuttle of the federation. It is not glamorous or special
but it gets the job done.

The Type 20 is found throughout starfleet on small and medium starships.

#### Type 23 Shuttle

![Medium Shuttle](images/small/shuttle-medium.png)

##### Description

The Type 23 is a larger shuttle than the type 20. It has all the equipment in correspondingly larger
quantities and capabilities.

The Type 23 is also ubiquitous in medium and large starships.

#### Type 3 large shuttle

![large shuttle](images/small/shuttle-large.png)

##### Description

At 18m long the Type 3 is more of a mini-runabout than a shuttle. 

It is frequently found in medium starships as a runabout, and in large and very large starships as shuttle.

#### Pirahna Class Fighter

![Fighter](images/small/fighter.png)

[View 3d](https://github.com/prasannax1/starships/blob/master/stl/small/fighter.stl)

Pirahna class fighter

##### Stats

  - Width: 7.9m
  - Height: 2.4m
  - Crew Capacity: 2
  - Warp Speed
    - Cruising: See Note
    - Peak: Warp 9.5

##### Description

The Pirahna class is an atmospheric and exo single or double occupancy fighter meant for planetary and star system defence.

This means that although it has warp, its only used to warp at maximum speed to any part of a star system to start engaging the 
enemy. All the manouvers happen at impulse speeds after that.

#### Amazon Class Runabout

![Runabout](images/small/runabout.png)

##### Description

The Amazon class is nominally of the same dimensions as the *Danube* or *Yellowstone* class but because of its boxy build has twice the
capacity. 

The Amazon class is fast rising up to become the standard runabout in all classes of starship and starbase that can carry a runabout.

##### Description

The Ganges class straddles the line between a small and intermediate ship and falls into the small ship category
by about 1m. But with two decks and even a sizable shuttlebay the Ganges can easily be a small starship rather
than an auxillary vehicle.

##### Auxillary vehicles

- Bumblebee class shuttlepod
- misc land vehicles
